            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <dev>The Cube360 app is a collaborative project developed as part of the Google Developer Club. 
                It was designed to assist volunteers in tracking and managing their volunteer hours efficiently. 
                My partner and I focused on building a feature that enables users to log their hours, view their total hours for the year, and check their all-time hours with a simple click. 
                Additionally, we implemented a table that displays nearby Cube360 events, which are fetched dynamically from a Firebase database. 
                Admin users can add new events to the system, while non-admin users can only view the events. 
                Furthermore, any edits made to volunteer hours are stored in the user's Firebase account for future reference. 
                This project was developed using Flutter, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
