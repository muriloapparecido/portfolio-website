            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <dev>This project started as a simple Python program to simulate a game of Blackjack, aimed at understanding 
                the game’s mechanics and developing basic programming skills. The current version uses Python to create 
                a command-line interface for players to simulate a game against the dealer.

            <h2>What I’ve Done</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Created a Python program that generates a shuffled deck of cards, deals cards to the player and dealer, and calculates scores.</li>
                <li>Implemented game logic for player actions (<code>HIT</code> or <code>STAND</code>) and win conditions such as busts and ties.</li>
                <li>Focused on making the code modular and reusable for future enhancements.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Future Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop a frontend for the simulator to replace the command-line interface with a user-friendly graphical interface.</li>
                <li>Expand the project to include animations, sound effects, and interactive features to make it more engaging.</li>
                <li>Eventually create a complete Blackjack game website, allowing users to play directly in their browsers and potentially integrate multiplayer functionality.</li>
