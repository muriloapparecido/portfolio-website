            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <dev>The Rock, Paper, Scissors simulator is a project I developed as part of the Odin Project curriculum. 
                It implements the classic game logic where players compete against a computer opponent, making selections of "rock," "paper," or "scissors." 
                The program determines the winner based on the standard rules of the game and provides feedback on the results.

            <h2>What Iâ€™ve Done</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented the core game logic using JavaScript, including random computer choices and win/loss determination.</li>
                <li>Designed the program to run entirely in the console, providing clear and interactive outputs for the user.</li>
                <li>Created reusable functions to allow multiple rounds of play, ensuring the game is easy to extend or modify.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a user-friendly graphical interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the game visually engaging.</li>
                <li>Implement advanced features like a scoreboard to track wins, losses, and ties over multiple rounds.</li>
